### 💻 About Me

I'm currently a B.Tech student passionate about coding, learning new tech, and building cool stuff with **C++**. I recently completed an internship at **CodSoft**, where I built beginner-friendly console applications like a calculator, to-do list, and number guessing game — all using C++.

I also love capturing the world through my lens and editing photos in my free time.
